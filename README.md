# Block and Function Prop spacing for eslint

This plugin specifies and enforces spacing decisions around block and function
definitions as properties that we've made at OkCupid.

The two rules that this plugin adds are:

* [space-around-blocks](https://github.com/mgeraci/eslint-plugin-block-function-spacing/blob/master/docs/rules/space-around-blocks.md)
* [space-before-function-prop](https://github.com/mgeraci/eslint-plugin-block-function-spacing/blob/master/docs/rules/space-before-function-prop.md)

## Development

After cloning, `npm install`. Then, to run the tests, type:

	npm run test
